Random quote generator by Jacob Baer

The main goal of this project is to make a random quote generator
that prints a quote on a webpage. Side goals include having tags as to whether quotes are "funny", "historical", "inspirational", etc. Another goal is to have the page refresh and change colors after a set time.
